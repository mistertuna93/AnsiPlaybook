* Overview
This module sets up a robust, ad-blocking DNS service with optional layout styles for:

- =pihole= :: Classic DNS with integrated adblocking.
- =adguard= :: Modern, GUI-rich DNS and adblock manager.
- =dev= :: Development layout — deploys both to allow testing side by side.

Logging, best practices, and health checks are included across all configurations.

* Variables
#+begin_src yaml :tangle literal/vars/dns.yml
dns_layout: dev  # Options: pihole, adguard, dev
dns_domain: home.local
pihole_password: changeme
adguard_admin_port: 3000
#+end_src

* Notes
#+begin_quote
Select the layout by setting =dns_layout= to one of the accepted values. Each layout will include base configuration for DNS resolution and integrated adblocking. If =dev= is selected, both stacks are deployed for comparison or testing.

# DNS Module

This module configures DNS and ad-blocking via Pi-hole, AdGuard Home, or both (dev layout). The layout is selectable in `dns.yml`.

## Layout Options

- `pihole` — Lightweight Pi-hole instance.
- `adguard` — Rich GUI DNS blocker.
- `dev` — Deploy both side-by-side for testing.

## Configuration

Edit `literal/vars/dns.yml` to select your layout and define any secrets or ports.

All instances expose DNS on port 53. AdGuard also exposes the admin panel on port 3000 by default.
